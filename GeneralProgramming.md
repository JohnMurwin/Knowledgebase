# Fundamentals of Programming
---
## Languages from Scratch
- [Learn C++](http://www.learncpp.com/)   
Get a firm grasp on C++ (one of the primary languages for GameDev).   

- [Learn C#](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/)   
Get a basic understanding of the language of choice for Unity Development.   

- [Learn Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)   
Get a full understanding of the primary language of Androids and devices everywhere.    

- [Learn Kotlin](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kotlin/index.htm)   
The modern language of Google and the Android platform. Secure, Short, and Advanced.   

- [Learn Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)   
The new modern language of choice from Apple.

## Problem Solving
- [Programming Problems: vol 1](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Problems-Primer-Technical-Interview/dp/1475071965)   
A Primer for the Technical Interview by Bradley Greene. Close to Fundamentals of Programming 1/2 + Data Structures (and much more). *Learn C++ before cracking open this series!* Uses “book-friendly” C++, and often code that would not pass a professional review; however the purpose of this book is not to teach C++, but instead to teach problem solving.   

- [Programming Problems: vol 2](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Problems-Advanced-Algorithms-2/dp/1484964098/)   
Advanced Algorithms by Bradley Greene. Covers Algorithm Analysis, and then much more to provide the tools to pass most whiteboard interview problems presented in Game Development interviews.
